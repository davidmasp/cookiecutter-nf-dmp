# README

My own cookiecutter for [nextflow pipelines](https://www.nextflow.io/).

This is supposed to be my own standard, another option which has a big 
community is available at
[nf-core](https://nf-co.re/tools#creating-a-new-workflow).
I'll try to make it as similar as possible so the migration towards
nf-core can be easily performed.

You can see this as a self-use template for pipeline projects.
If it is useful to you, please feel free to use it and contribute.

## Usage

You need a installation of
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and then just run:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:davidmasp/cookiecutter-nf-dmp
```

### Structure

An empty file structure can look like this:

```bash
# TODO
```

note though that this is a minimal set up, and this template is thought to
scale with more directories easily.
A possible working file structure can be the following:

```bash
# TODO
```
